This serves as a list of requirements for a personal dropbox clone.

1) No concept of a server or client.
    Each actor in this system should be the same. No 'server' should exist
2) An arbitrary number of clients can receive changes from any given node.
3) Multiple folders on a single machine should be kept track of independently
        Each can have multiple differing clients
        Each can be synchronized independently.
        Each can be configured independently.
        Folder location should be local to the machine.
4) A mechanism should exist to lock out unwanted clients from watching a given
    folder for changes. Information shouldn't leak; a denied folder should
    look the same as a non-permissioned folder.
5) Nodes should be able to instantly get changes from other nodes.
        Can we do this without pushing changes?
        How do we prevent a cyclical push? do we care?
6) Offline nodes need to be able to sync the backlog of changes when they come
    online.
7) Expired data should be pruned.
        Expired could mean after X amount of time, or X changes, or X size...
8) Mutually edited files should be caught and reported, or at least recoverable
    with no interruption in service.
9) Because this is to work on multiple machines, we should be ownership, group,
    etc. agnostic.

NTH:
    Files of arbitrary size
    All files encrypted to access.
    Full change-for-change history of all files everywhere, even across rebases
        and other mucking with our history locally.
    git-like command structure for funtime scriptableness.
        (sync [opts] command [opts] -> sync-command [opts])
How does this look to us?
Subsystems:
    git for version tracking of files. Each node should keep track of an 
        independent history of a file. Benefit of this is that any given corrupt
        node history won't fuck over everything, and there is no real full-stop
        issued when things start to diverge/be pruned.
        Drawback is that pruning will do a full edit of history, and that no
        'master' copy of the history exists. The question of if a master copy
        can exist when subject to pruning is another issue.
        We might have some success using the packfiles directly.
    rsync for synchronization between nodes.
        librsync is another option -- We could use the diffs directly from 
        rsync to create a patch in git, and use that. Look ma, full history?
        We might need to fuck with C on this one.
    ssh for transport mechanism
Custom modules are the 'glue'. From this I can see:
    daemon to listen for events in our files and create a change.
    daemon to listen for changes and notify our clientele about them.
    daemon to listen for events from our clientele and pull them into ours.
    interface to edit our history, revert changes.

    Among the sub-components are:
        Control and tracking for git repository and file changes
        Control and tracking for client registration, etc.
        Execution of subsystem projects.
