Dewdrop
======= 

Dewdrop is a program built to help synchronize multiple folders with those on
remote machines. The utility of it is mostly inspired by dropbox, and the
interface is heavily influenced by git.

You might want to use dewdrop if you're bored, insane, have your data already
backed up with something better (I recommend using `bup`) and you feel like
experimenting with a toy project.

You might want to avoid dewdrop if you want to contribute to a more developed
and actively maintained project.

Getting started
---------------

In order to get dewdrop, check out the source from git

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/bakergo/dewdrop
</pre>

### Installation ###

To install, run the included setup script

<pre>
./setup.py build
./setup.py install
</pre>

### Initializing ###

Initializing a folder to synchronize is as simple as running the init command
<pre>
ddr init
ddr init /path/to/define/a/folder/
</pre>

### Remotes ###

The ddr remote command will identify a remote server to synchronize against.
Since dewdrop uses rsync for most of its operations, this command takes an
rsync url as a parameter. The remote commands are fairly similar to that used
by git.

<pre>
ddr remote add user-sync ssh://user@example.com/~/my/sync/folder
ddr remote remove user-sync 
</pre>

### Synchronizing ###

In order to synchronize with the remote folder, you can use push, pull, or sync
The sync command is the same as doing a push, then a pull.
<pre>
ddr push user-sync
ddr sync
</pre>

There are other commands as well, experiment with them.
